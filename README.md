# Data Encryption Standard (DES)

#### An implementation of DES encryption from scratch
#### For a high school project about different encryption algorithms I chose to implement one myself.

## Skills Used in this Project:
* Creating a program that would work acording to very exact specifications
* Abillity to break down large projects into simple pieces
* Deep understanding of bitwise opperations in C++
* Learned about common security principles of encryption algorithms
* Learned step-by-step how DES operates

This project was created to learn about process not secuirty so this code is most likely not safe for any real use
